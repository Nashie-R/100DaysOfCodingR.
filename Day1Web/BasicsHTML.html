    You're sucrose, you're glucose,
    You're fructose and more,
    From your head to your feet...
    Which are stuck to the floor.

    You're Hershey's, you're Snickers,
    You're sweet English Toffee.
    If you spit in my cup,
    You'll just sweeten my coffee.

    I love you so much
    That I'm getting frenetic,
    But I can't even kiss you,
    'cause I'm diabetic.
